Week 1 Top Performers - Cowboys D/ST 35.0 pts
Okay, my thoughts before the Bills @ Jets game.
I expected to lose this week due to my #1.01 draft pick, Kelce being out.
However, by sheer circumstance and "analytical driven decision making" the Dallas Cowboys D/ST showed their teeth.
The Jets have a tough secondary, but Josh Allen is a dual threat QB- and there are lots of hungry mouths to feed.
If Allen can scramble for the run game, it's a wrap combined with Buffalo's defense.
Of course, Tyler Bass can just do field goals. I have him too. Just need 30 pts.
